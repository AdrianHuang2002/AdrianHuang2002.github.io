Iâ€™m a first-year M.S. student in Computer Science at UMass Amherst, where I work with the
[Embodied AGI Group](https://embodied-agi.cs.umass.edu/people/) led by
[Chuang Gan](https://people.csail.mit.edu/ganchuang/).
Previously, I was part of the UMD [Gamma Group](https://gamma.umd.edu/) mentored by
[Xijun Wang](https://xijun-cs.github.io/) and under the guidance of
[Dinesh Manocha](https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/dmanocha). Iâ€™ve also collaborated with
[John P. Dickerson](https://jpdickerson.com/) in the Dickerson Lab.

My current research interests are primarily centered on **humanoid robots**.
